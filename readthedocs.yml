# Config file for Sphinx build on ReadTheDocs:
# https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/index.html
# https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
#
# extra_requirements is the important one. docs/conf.py configures sphinx to use
# autodoc, which generates docs from docstrings in code. It imports the code,
# which depends on the App Engine SDK.
